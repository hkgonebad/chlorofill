ChloroFill is a modern, responsive web application showcasing meal and cocktail recipes, built with Vue 3.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of modern frontend technologies to create a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA). It started as a static layout and evolved into a feature-rich app using:

*   **Vue 3 (Composition API):** Leveraging `<script setup>` for clean and efficient component development.
*   **Vite & Bun:** Ensuring a fast development experience and optimized builds.
*   **External APIs:** Fetching recipe data from TheMealDB and TheCocktailDB, with development proxy setup to handle CORS.
*   **Routing:** Client-side navigation managed by Vue Router, including dynamic routes and lazy-loading.
*   **Styling:** Responsive design achieved with Bootstrap 5 (SCSS) and custom theming, including a persistent light/dark mode toggle.
*   **State Management:** Utilizing Vue Composables for managing global state (Theme, LocalStorage Favorites).

## Key Features & Technical Highlights

*   **Dual Recipe Types:** Browse and search both meal and cocktail recipes.
*   **Responsive UI:** Mobile-first design using Bootstrap 5 SCSS.
*   **Dark Mode:** Persistent theme switching with smooth transitions.
*   **API Interaction:**
    *   Async data fetching from multiple REST APIs.
    *   Vite proxy for handling CORS in development.
    *   Simple in-memory caching with TTL for API responses.
*   **Client-Side Favorites:** Save favorite recipes locally using `localStorage`.
*   **Search Functionality:** Debounced, combined search across both recipe APIs.
*   **UI Components:** Reusable components for cards, carousels, modals, loaders, error messages.
*   **SEO Basics:** Dynamic page titles and meta descriptions using `@vueuse/head`.
*   **Modern Tooling:** Built with Vite and managed with Bun.
